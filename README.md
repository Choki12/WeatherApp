# WeatherApp
I'm sorry Ms Jackson. You can plan a pretty picnic. But you can't predict the weather. I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real..

This a .NET Core Console App that reads weather data from the weatherstack api (https://weatherstack.com).
The api is queried with a city name and the api key and the response is returned in JSON deserialized into a data weather data model and parsed based on specific weather data required.
